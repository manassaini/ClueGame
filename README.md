# ClueGame
Private repository for Clue Game CSCI 306

My partner and I together developed a Clue Game for our Software Engineering class spring semester of sophomore year. Rules of the game can be found here:https://www.ultraboardgames.com/clue/game-rules.php. This project focused on writing clean object oriented code and using Agile. I am lucky to have developed this project as it gave me an idea of what writing code in an industry setting is like. In addition, this was the first project where I used version control. Doing a deep dive in that was really beneficial to me. I was able to apply Git and version control to my future projects such as C++ Basic DSA and my Website. To keep it brief, this project was full of learning.

Tools/Technologies: Java, Agile, TDD, Java Swing, JUnit, Git

Project Scope: 2.5 months, 14 class files, 5,000+ lines of code, 97 commits
